# datastar-bun-hono-example

This is a minimal example of a [Datastar](https://data-star.dev/) app using
[Bun](https://bun.sh/), and [Hono](https://hono.dev/). See the `hono-sse.ts`
file for the Hono SSE implementation.

Note that `hono-sse.ts` was generated by AI, based on the published
[reference implementation](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/tree/main/sdk/typescript/src)
and the [specification](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/tree/main/sdk).

```bash
bun i
bun dev
```
